# 📝 OOP Concepts — Handwritten Notes

This repository contains handwritten notes covering the essential topics in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — ideal for quick revision, interview prep, or exam study.

---

## 📚 Overview

These notes are designed to simplify and reinforce your understanding of OOP. Topics are structured with a dual-column layout:  
**Left side = theory**, **Right side = code examples or analogies**. Arrows (→) highlight relationships between ideas.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### ✅ Core OOP Principles
- **OOP Definition**: Object-Oriented Programming basics
- **Classes vs. Objects**
- **Access Specifiers**: `public`, `private`, `protected`

### 🏛️ Four Pillars of OOP
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and method bundling  
- **Inheritance**:  
  - Single  
  - Multilevel  
  - Multiple  
  - Hierarchical  
- **Polymorphism**:  
  - Compile-time (function overloading)  
  - Runtime (virtual functions)  
- **Abstraction**: Interfaces vs. implementation hiding

## 🛠️ Advanced Features
- Constructors & Destructors
- Static Members
- Friend Functions & Friend Classes
